Put instructions for the semdial plotter here.

The basic directions:
1. python semdial_demo.py
2. Pick colors.
3. At the bottom, input a color description to see which color it gets resolved

The two columns for each color represent the pre-competitor normalization and post-competitor normalization.  In other words, when two colors are given, the descriptions should be resolved to one color and not the other.  This it the Y-And-Not-Z task.  The right columns represent the result of our algorithm for the Y-And-Not-Z task for color.
